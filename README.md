# FastAPI-Database
## Master Branch

This branch is a base for other branches. Reason behind it is that I will surely create variations of APIs so there is no need to create a repository for every single one when branches can do it better.``` __init__.py ```contains commands to get started with virtual enviroment and run local server.

Basic Structure Is:
- app:
    - __init__.py
    - database.py
    - main.py
    - models.py
    - schemas.py
- templates (empty):
- requirements.txt
